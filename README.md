# customer-churn-app

Description
This project is a web app built with Streamlit that predicts if a customer will leave a telecommunications company (customer churn) using machine learning. The app uses a pre-trained model to analyze input features like how long a customer has been with the company (tenure), their monthly charges, and whether they use internet services. Based on this information, it predicts if the customer is likely to stay or leave.

The app provides a simple and user-friendly interface, making it easy for users to understand customer churn predictions. This can be very useful for telecommunications companies, helping them to improve their customer retention strategies by understanding why customers might leave based on past data.
